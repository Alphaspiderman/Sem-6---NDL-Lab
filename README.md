# NDL Lab

This repository contains a compilation of lab programs completed during the sixth semester in the NDL (Neural Networks & Deep Learning) Lab.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference for lab exercises undertaken during the sixth semester. It's intended to provide insights into problem-solving approaches and solutions implemented during the lab sessions.

## Notes
- Programs listed here are based on personal attempts during lab sessions. They may not cover all programs outlined in the lab manual and might include additional exercises attempted that the lab instructor gave.
- The solutions presented here may not represent the most optimal or cleanest implementations. There is always room for improvement, and better solutions may exist.
